# Python - Test-driven Development 🧪🐍

This project introduced the **Test-driven Development (TDD)** approach in Python. It emphasized writing tests **before** writing the actual function code, using both `doctest` and `unittest`. I also learned how to handle edge cases, structure test files, and satisfy strict checker formatting.

---

## 📘 What I Learned

- Writing Python functions with proper input validation and exception handling
- Creating doctest-based `.txt` test files and running them with `python3 -m doctest`
- Using `unittest` module to create test classes and run with `python3 -m unittest`
- Understanding checker expectations, including formatting and edge cases
- Detecting and handling float-related exceptions (e.g., `float('inf')`, `float('nan')`)
- Proper documentation and module testing structure

## 📂 Tasks Completed

- `0-add_integer.py`: Adds two integers or floats casted to int, with TypeError on invalid input
- `1-divide.py`: Divides two numbers safely, using try/except/finally
- `2-matrix_divided.py`: Divides elements of a 2D matrix, ensuring consistent row sizes and value types
- `3-say_my_name.py`: Prints a full name, validating both inputs as strings
- `4-print_square.py`: Prints a square of `#` based on a given integer size
- `5-text_indentation.py`: Prints formatted text with 2 newlines after `.`, `?`, and `:`, removing leading spaces
- `6-max_integer.py`: Returns the max integer in a list
- `tests/6-max_integer_test.py`: Unit tests for `max_integer()` using `unittest`

## 🧠 Skills Gained

- Test-driven development workflow
- Writing doctests and `.txt` test files in checker-approved format
- Creating and running `unittest.TestCase`-based test suites
- Robust input validation and exception handling
- Managing float and NaN edge cases
- Creating clean, testable, and well-documented Python functions
