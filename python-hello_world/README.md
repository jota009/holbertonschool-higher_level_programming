# Python - Hello, World 🌍🐍

This project is part of my introduction to Python. It covers the basics of Python syntax, printing output, working with strings and numbers, and getting familiar with formatting and code style.

## 📘 What I Learned

- Writing and executing basic Python scripts
- Printing strings and variables using `print()`
- Using `.format()` and f-strings for string formatting
- Printing integers and floats without casting
- String manipulation: slicing, concatenation, and repetition
- Understanding how Python handles escape characters and newlines
- Writing simple functions
- Using comments and the shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/python3`)
- Following PEP8 styling using `pycodestyle`

## 📂 Tasks Completed

- `2-print.py`: Printed a basic string with proper syntax
- `3-print_number.py`: Printed an integer using `.format()` without casting
- `4-print_float.py`: Printed a float with 2 decimal places
- `5-print_string.py`: Printed a string 3 times, then its first 9 characters
- `6-concat.py`: Concatenated two strings using f-strings
- `7-edges.py`: Extracted and printed specific parts of a string using slicing
- `8-concat_edges.py`: Combined parts of a string to form a custom sentence
- `9-easter_egg.py`: Printed the Zen of Python using a one-liner

## 🧠 Skills Gained

- Basic string and number manipulation
- Python’s `print()` and formatting tools
- File permissions and script execution
- Writing clean and readable Python code
