🚀 Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT

Welcome to a specialized module of our IT curriculum where we explore how artificial intelligence—specifically ChatGPT—can be seamlessly integrated into everyday coding practices to elevate software development.
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on two pivotal aspects of modern programming:

    🔍 Debugging

    ⚙️ Automation

By engaging in hands-on activities using ChatGPT, you’ll learn how to identify and fix code errors faster, as well as automate repetitive development tasks. This module is designed to make your workflow smarter, more efficient, and better aligned with industry practices.
🎯 Objectives
🐞 Debugging

    Use ChatGPT to identify, diagnose, and resolve coding errors.

    Gain insights into common pitfalls across different programming languages.

    Enhance your ability to communicate problems clearly and implement effective fixes.

🔁 Automation

    Automate boilerplate code, documentation, and basic unit tests using AI.

    Improve productivity by reducing time spent on repetitive tasks.

    Focus more on creative and complex problem-solving.

✅ Outcomes

    Improved Debugging Skills: Build confidence in spotting and correcting bugs using AI-assisted methods.

    Automation Proficiency: Learn to use ChatGPT to generate clean, structured, and reliable code faster.

🛠️ Real-World Applications

This project simulates real-world development environments, encouraging you to:

    Use AI responsibly and efficiently.

    Critically evaluate AI-generated solutions.

    Think like a software engineer prepared for future AI-integrated workflows.

🔍 Reminder

    Always test, verify, and critically assess any code or suggestions provided by ChatGPT. AI is a powerful assistant—but you are the developer in control.
