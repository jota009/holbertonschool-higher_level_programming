# Python - Exceptions üêç‚ö†Ô∏è

This project focuses on handling errors and exceptions in Python. It covers how to catch, raise, and handle runtime errors cleanly using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and custom exception messages.

---

## üìò What I Learned

- The difference between **errors** and **exceptions**
- How and when to use `try`, `except`, and `finally`
- How to raise exceptions like `TypeError` and `NameError` manually
- How to safely handle division and iteration errors
- How to implement cleanup actions after an exception
- Python‚Äôs exception hierarchy and why catching only needed exceptions is best

## üìÇ Tasks Completed

- **0-safe_print_list.py:** Printed up to `x` elements of a list safely using `try/except` and counted how many were printed
- **1-safe_print_integer.py:** Printed an integer if it was one, skipped and returned `False` otherwise
- **2-safe_print_list_integers.py:** Printed only integer elements from a list, handling incorrect types and counting successful prints
- **3-safe_print_division.py:** Printed and returned the result of dividing two integers using `finally:` to always print
- **4-list_division.py:** Divided elements from two lists while handling type mismatches, index issues, and division by zero
- **5-raise_exception.py:** Intentionally raised a `TypeError`
- **6-raise_exception_msg.py:** Raised a `NameError` with a custom message

## üß† Skills Gained

- Mastery of `try/except/finally` syntax
- Selective exception handling (`TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, `IndexError`)
- Using `raise` to trigger exceptions
- Implementing logic for safe iteration and arithmetic
- Creating robust, fault-tolerant functions
