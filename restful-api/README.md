# üåê RESTful API ‚Äì Higher Level Programming

## Introduction

Welcome to the RESTful API project, where the focus is on building, consuming, and securing APIs using Python. REST (Representational State Transfer) is the backbone of modern web services, ensuring **scalable**, **stateless**, and **cacheable** communication between systems. Mastering RESTful APIs enables efficient integration, data exchange, and automation in today‚Äôs digital world.

## üìö Learning Objectives

- **HTTP/HTTPS Basics:** Understand the fundamentals of web communication, including request/response structure and secure data transfer.
- **API Consumption with Command Line:** Practice interacting with APIs using tools like `curl` for hands-on learning.
- **API Consumption with Python:** Use Python‚Äôs `requests` library to fetch, parse, and manipulate data from APIs.
- **API Development with `http.server`:** Build simple web APIs from scratch using Python‚Äôs built-in modules.
- **API Development with Flask:** Create robust APIs with Flask, focusing on endpoints, routing, data management, and scalability.
- **API Security & Authentication:** Learn the basics of API protection, including authentication (Basic Auth, JWT) and authorization.
- **API Standards & Documentation:** Discover best practices for documenting and standardizing APIs for maintainability.

## üåç Why RESTful APIs Matter

APIs are everywhere: from social apps and banking systems to industrial automation. RESTful APIs act as **middlemen**, translating client requests into actions, fetching data, and triggering automated workflows.
Learning how to build, use, and secure APIs is an essential skill for any modern software engineer.

  Client            Web Server           API Server           Database


- **Client:** Sends requests (e.g., browsers, apps)
- **Web Server:** Receives and routes requests
- **API Server:** Handles business logic and data processing
- **Database:** Stores and retrieves data as needed

## üîÑ Typical REST API Flow

1. **Client** sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the Web Server.
2. **Web Server** routes the request to the API Server.
3. **API Server** processes the request, interacts with the Database.
4. **API Server** returns a response to the Web Server.
5. **Web Server** delivers the final HTTP/HTTPS response to the Client.

> *Note: In simpler setups, Web and API Server may be the same process. In scaled environments, they are often separate for flexibility and performance.*
