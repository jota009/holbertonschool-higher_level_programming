# Python - Classes and Objects 🏗️🐍

This project covers the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming in Python: creating classes, managing private attributes, using properties for controlled access, and defining class behavior through methods.

---

## 📘 What I Learned

- Defining classes and creating instances
- The purpose of the `__init__` constructor and `self` reference
- Encapsulation with private attributes and Python’s name mangling
- Using `@property` and setter decorators to validate and expose attributes
- Writing public methods (`area()`, `my_print()`) that operate on instance data
- Handling invalid inputs with `TypeError` and `ValueError`
- Structuring module, class, and method docstrings to satisfy automated checkers

## 📂 Tasks Completed

- **0-square.py**: Empty `Square` class skeleton
- **1-square.py**: Private `__size` attribute, basic instantiation
- **2-square.py**: Validation of `size` in constructor, `area()` method
- **3-square.py**: Property `size` with getter and setter for validation
- **4-square.py**: `my_print()` method to render the square with `#`
- **5-square.py**: Property `position` for X/Y offsets, updated `my_print()` supports spacing

## 🧠 Skills Gained

- Core OOP concepts: classes, instances, attributes, methods
- Data encapsulation and information hiding
- Pythonic getters and setters with `@property`
- Building robust classes with input validation
- Designing methods that encapsulate behavior (computing area, printing shapes)
