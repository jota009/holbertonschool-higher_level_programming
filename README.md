Holberton School – Higher Level Programming 💻🐍

This repository contains my solutions to the Higher Level Programming projects at Holberton School, using Python 3. These projects reinforce foundational concepts in programming, from basic syntax up through object-oriented design, testing, and modular architecture.
🗂️ Projects
### 📘 `python-hello_world`
My introduction to Python programming. I learned:
- ✨ Writing and running Python scripts with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- 🖨️ Printing strings, integers, and floats without casting
- 🎨 String formatting using `.format()` and f-strings
- 🔪 String slicing, concatenation, and repetition
- 📏 Setting file permissions and following PEP8 with `pycodestyle`

### 📗 `python-if_else_loops_functions`
Deep dive into conditionals, loops, and functions:
- 🔀 `if` / `elif` / `else` statements
- 🔁 `for` and `while` loops with `break` and `continue`
- 🤏 Ternary expressions and short-circuit logic
- 🆚 Using `ord()` and `chr()` for character tests
- 🎲 Classic logic puzzles like FizzBuzz


🎚️ Control Flow

    Conditionals: if, elif, else

    Loops: for, while

    Loop controls: break, continue

    Ternary: <true> if <cond> else <false>

    Short-circuit: and / or

🗄️ Data Structures

    Lists: mutable ordered sequences

    Tuples: immutable ordered sequences

    Sets: unordered collections of unique elements

    Dictionaries: key → value mappings

    Comprehensions: concise syntax for building lists/sets/dicts

🛑 Errors & Exceptions

    Built-in exceptions: ValueError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError

    try / except / else / finally for robust handling

    Raising your own: raise ValueError("…")

    Clean-up actions in finally

🧪 Test-Driven Development

    Doctests in tests/*.txt, run with:

python3 -m doctest ./tests/*

Unittest / pytest modules, run with:

python3 -m unittest tests.my_test_module

Docstring checks via:

    python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'

    Edge-case coverage and style enforcement with pycodestyle

📦 Modules & Imports

    Splitting code into modules (.py files)

    Import patterns:

        import module

        from package import submodule

    Organizing packages with __init__.py

    Checking module docstrings at runtime:

    python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'

🤖 Classes & Objects

    Class vs. Instance: blueprint vs. concrete object

    Attributes: public, protected (_attr), private (__attr)

    The self reference in instance methods

    Special methods (dunders) for built-in hooks:

        __init__ (constructor)

        __str__ / __repr__ (string representations)

        __del__ (cleanup)

    Properties: @property getters and @x.setter for validation

    Class methods (@classmethod) as alternative constructors

    Static methods (@staticmethod) for utility routines

    OOP principles: encapsulation, abstraction, and dynamic attribute binding

📎 General Skills Learned

    ✅ Clean, modular Python code organization

    🔄 Understanding control flow and built-in functions

    🛑 Applying error handling with exceptions

    🧪 Writing and running tests (doctest, unittest)

    🐍 Embracing Pythonic idioms and style guidelines
