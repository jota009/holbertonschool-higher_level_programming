# Holberton School – Higher Level Programming 💻🐍

This repository contains my solutions to the Higher Level Programming projects at Holberton School, using Python 3.
These projects reinforce foundational concepts in programming—from basic syntax up through object-oriented design, testing, data structures, serialization, and modular architecture.

## 🗂️ Projects

---

### 📘 `python-hello_world`
My introduction to Python programming.
I learned:
- ✨ Writing and running Python scripts with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- 🖨️ Printing strings, integers, and floats without casting
- 🎨 String formatting using `.format()` and f-strings
- 🔪 String slicing, concatenation, and repetition
- 📏 Setting file permissions and following PEP8 with `pycodestyle`

---

### 📗 `python-if_else_loops_functions`
Deep dive into conditionals, loops, and functions:
- 🔀 `if` / `elif` / `else` statements
- 🔁 `for` and `while` loops with `break` and `continue`
- 🤏 Ternary expressions and short-circuit logic
- 🆚 Using `ord()` and `chr()` for character tests
- 🎲 Classic logic puzzles like FizzBuzz

---

### 📂 `python-import_modules`
- 📦 Importing and reusing code across files/modules
- 🗃️ Organizing packages with `__init__.py`

### 🗃️ `python-data_structures`
Fundamental data types and transformations:
- 📋 Lists (mutable), tuples (immutable), sets (unique)
- 🔑 Dictionaries for key-value mapping

- 🔁 Basic matrix manipulations

---

### 🧩 `python-more_data_structures`
Advanced data structures and algorithms:
- ➕ Set operations: union, intersection, difference
- 📊 Dictionary iteration and manipulation
- 🏷️ Deep dives into comprehensions and sorting
- 📝 Handling complex data collections

---

### 🏛️ `python-classes`
Object-oriented programming essentials:
- 👤 Defining classes, instantiating objects
- 🔐 Private, public, and protected attributes
- 🏗️ Constructors, destructors, and special methods
- 🏷️ Properties and custom string representations

---

### 🧬 `python-inheritance`
- 🔗 Building class hierarchies via inheritance
- 🎨 Overriding parent methods for custom behavior

- 👑 Using `super()` and Method Resolution Order (MRO)

---

### ⏬ `python-exceptions`
- 🛑 Handling runtime errors with `try/except/else/finally`
- 🚨 Raising custom exceptions
- 📏 Writing robust, fail-safe functions

---

### 🧪 `python-test_driven_development`
- 📜 Writing and running doctests/unittests
- 🧪 Using assertions to check code correctness

- 🗃️ Organizing test suites in a `tests/` folder

---

### 🗂️ `python-input_output`
- 📖 Reading from and writing to files (with context managers)
- ✏️ Appending, overwriting, and reading text files
- 🔤 Encoding best practices (`UTF-8`)
- 🗣️ Handling command-line arguments with `sys.argv`
- 📄 JSON serialization with the `json` module

---

### 🧷 `python-serialization`
- 🔄 Converting Python objects to/from JSON, Pickle, CSV, and XML
- 💾 Saving and restoring program data in multiple formats
- 🗂️ Working with custom object serialization
- ⚠️ Understanding data safety, type conversion, and security

---

### 🎭 `python-abstract_classes`
- 🏛️ Defining abstract classes and methods with `abc`
- 🦆 Implementing interfaces and duck typing
- 🧬 Subclassing built-in types for custom behavior
- ⚡ Method overriding, multiple inheritance, and mixins
- 🏗️ Designing modular, extensible OOP architectures

---

## 📝 General Skills Learned

- ✅ Clean, modular Python code organization
- 🔄 Understanding control flow and built-in functions
- 🛑 Applying error handling with exceptions
- 🧪 Writing and running tests (doctest, unittest)
