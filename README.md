# Holberton School - Higher Level Programming 💻🐍

This repository contains my solutions to the Higher Level Programming projects at Holberton School, using Python 3. These projects are designed to reinforce foundational concepts in programming, starting from simple syntax to more advanced topics such as conditionals, loops, functions, and modular programming.

## 🗂️ Projects

### 📁 python-hello_world

This was my introduction to Python programming. I learned:
- How to write and run Python scripts
- Basic syntax: printing strings, integers, and floats
- String formatting using `.format()` and f-strings
- String slicing, concatenation, and repetition
- Using the shebang (`#!/usr/bin/python3`) and file permissions
- Clean code practices using `pycodestyle`

### 📁 python-if_else_loops_functions

This project focused on Python conditionals, loops, and functions. I practiced:
- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- `for` and `while` loops with `range()`
- Writing custom functions with `return`
- Using `ord()` and `chr()` for character manipulation
- Checking for lowercase characters without built-ins
- Implementing classic logic challenges like FizzBuzz

## 📎 General Skills Learned

- Writing clean, readable, and modular Python code
- Understanding Python execution flow
- Using built-in functions effectively
- Applying logical thinking and control structures
- Following PEP8 coding style using `pycodestyle`
