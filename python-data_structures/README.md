# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is focused on mastering Python's fundamental data structures — **lists** and **tuples**. You’ll learn how to manipulate, access, and process sequences in Python, as well as understand when to use each structure depending on the context.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- What are lists and how to use them
- What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the `del` statement and how to use it

## 📝 Tasks

### 0. Print a list of integers
- **Function:** `print_list_integer(my_list=[])`
- Prints each integer in a list using `str.format()`

---

### 1. Secure access to an element in a list
- **Function:** `element_at(my_list, idx)`
- Returns the element at a given index or `None` if out of range

---

### 2. Replace element
- **Function:** `replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element)`
- Replaces an element at a specific position (if valid)

---

### 3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
- **Function:** `print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[])`
- Prints integers from a list in reverse using `str.format()`

---

### 4. Replace in a copy
- **Function:** `new_in_list(my_list, idx, element)`
- Returns a copy of the list with one element replaced at a valid index

---

### 5. Can you C me now?
- **Function:** `no_c(my_string)`
- Returns a copy of the string with all `'c'` and `'C'` characters removed

---

### 6. Lists of lists = Matrix
- **Function:** `print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]])`
- Prints a matrix (list of lists) of integers using `str.format()`

---

### 7. Tuples addition
- **Function:** `add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=())`
- Adds two tuples element by element, using 0 for missing values

---

### 8. More returns!
- **Function:** `multiple_returns(sentence)`
- Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character (or `None`)

---

### 9. Find the max
- **Function:** `max_integer(my_list=[])`
- Returns the largest integer in the list, or `None` if the list is empty

---

### 10. Only by 2
- **Function:** `divisible_by_2(my_list=[])`
- Returns a list of booleans for each element: `True` if divisible by 2, else `False`

---

### 11. Delete at
- **Function:** `delete_at(my_list=[], idx=0)`
- Deletes the item at the specified index (if valid) using the `del` statement

---

### 12. Switch
- **Task:** Complete a 5-line script to switch values of `a` and `b`
- **Code used:**
```python
a, b = b, a
