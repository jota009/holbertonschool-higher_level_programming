# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples 📚🐍

This project deepens my understanding of Python’s most essential data structures — **lists** and **tuples**. It covers how to access, modify, and manipulate elements in sequences, how they differ, and when to use each.

---

## 📘 What I Learned

- How to define and use lists and tuples
- Accessing elements using indexing and slicing
- Using `if`, `for`, and `while` with sequences
- Understanding mutable vs immutable structures
- Working with nested lists (matrices)
- Using `del` to remove elements
- Tuple packing and unpacking
- The difference between `str`, `list`, and `tuple` types
- Creating condition-based lists (e.g. multiples of 2)
- Using Pythonic tools like tuple unpacking and list comprehensions (intro level)

## 📂 Tasks Completed

- **0-print_list_integer.py:** Printed a list of integers using `str.format()`
- **1-element_at.py:** Retrieved an element by index, safely handling out-of-range
- **2-replace_in_list.py:** Replaced an element at a given index (if valid)
- **3-print_reversed_list_integer.py:** Printed integers in reverse order
- **4-new_in_list.py:** Created a copy of a list with a modified element
- **5-no_c.py:** Returned a string with all `'c'` and `'C'` characters removed
- **6-print_matrix_integer.py:** Printed a matrix (list of lists) using `str.format()`
- **7-add_tuple.py:** Added two tuples element-wise, filling in missing values
- **8-multiple_returns.py:** Returned a tuple with the length of a string and its first character
- **9-max_integer.py:** Returned the largest integer in a list (without using `max()`)
- **10-divisible_by_2.py:** Returned a list of booleans for elements divisible by 2
- **11-delete_at.py:** Deleted an item from a list using `del`, safely handling invalid indexes
- **12-switch.py:** Swapped the values of two variables using tuple unpacking in a 5-line script
