# Python - if/else, loops, functions

## 📚 Description

This project introduces control flow tools in Python, including conditional statements, loops, and functions.  
It builds a solid foundation for writing logical, clean, and readable code using Python 3.8+ on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, I will be able to explain:

- Why indentation is so important in Python
- How to use `if`, `if ... else`, and `if ... elif ... else` statements
- How to write and use comments effectively
- How to assign values to variables
- How to use `while` and `for` loops
- How to use `break` and `continue` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- What the `pass` statement does and when to use it
- How to use the `range()` function
- What a function is and how to define and call one
- What happens if a function does not have a `return` statement
- What variable scope means in Python
- What a traceback is and how to read it
- The arithmetic operators and how to use them

## 🛠️ Requirements

- All Python files must be interpreted with Python 3.8.* on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- The first line of all files must be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All your files must be executable (`chmod +x file.py`)
- All files must end with a new line
- Use only the following editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Code must follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide
- Code must be checked with `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- File length may be tested with `wc`

## 🔧 Usage

To run a script:

```bash
./filename.py
```
