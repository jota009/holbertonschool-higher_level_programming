# Python -  More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary üß†üêç

This project builds on core Python data structures by introducing **dictionaries**, **sets**, and **functional programming tools** like `lambda`, `map()`, and `filter()`. It includes whiteboard-friendly logic tasks and interview-style exercises using Roman numerals, set operations, and dictionary transformations.

## üìò What I Learned

- The difference between lists, sets, and dictionaries in Python
- How and when to use `set()` and its common methods
- How to access, update, and delete key/value pairs in a dictionary
- Iterating over dictionaries and setss
- The structure of a dictionary key and value
- Using `lambda` functions for quick one-liners
- Applying `map()` to process entire lists efficiently
- Basic whiteboard logic: converting Roman numerals to integers

## üìÇ Tasks Completed

- **0-square_matrix_simple.py:** Returned a new matrix with squared values of each integer
- **1-search_replace.py:** Replaced all occurrences of a specific element in a list with another
- **2-uniq_add.py:** Added all unique integers in a list (no duplicates)
- **3-common_elements.py:** Returned a set of common elements from two sets
- **4-only_diff_elements.py:** Returned a set of elements present in only one of two sets
- **5-number_keys.py:** Returned the number of keys in a dictionary
- **6-print_sorted_dictionary.py:** Printed a dictionary ordered by keys
- **7-update_dictionary.py:** Replaced or added a key/value in a dictionary
- **8-simple_delete.py:** Deleted a key in a dictionary (if it exists)
- **9-multiply_by_2.py:** Returned a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
- **10-best_score.py:** Returned the key with the highest integer value in a dictionary
- **11-multiply_list_map.py:** Returned a list with all values multiplied by a number using `map()` and `lambda` (no loops)
- **12-roman_to_int.py:** Converted a Roman numeral string to an integer (whiteboard-friendly logic)
