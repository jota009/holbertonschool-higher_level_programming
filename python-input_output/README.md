# Python: Input and Output

> **‚ÄúProgramming isn‚Äôt just about logic‚Äîit‚Äôs about communicating with files, people, and the world.‚Äù**

---

## üìö Introduction

This project explores the fundamentals of **input and output (I/O) operations in Python**.
You‚Äôll practice reading from and writing to files, manipulating text data, and safely handling various file formats‚Äîskills that are essential for every Python developer.

---

## üöÄ Learning Objectives

- **Reading Files:**
  Learn how to open and read data from text files using Python‚Äôs built-in functions.

- **Writing and Appending Files:**
  Safely write to files (overwriting content) and append data without losing existing content.

- **File Modes and Encodings:**
  Understand file modes such as `"r"`, `"w"`, and `"a"`, and the importance of using UTF-8 encoding.

- **Context Management:**
  Use the `with` statement to handle files efficiently and prevent resource leaks.

- **Basic Exception Handling:**
  Know when to (and not to) handle file errors, and understand common scenarios where exceptions might occur.

- **JSON Serialization:**
  Convert Python data structures to JSON strings/files, and reconstruct them using the `json` module.

- **Command Line Arguments:**
  Process input data passed via the command line, and combine it with file operations for flexible scripts.

## üß© Key Concepts Explored

- **The `with` Statement:** Ensures files are automatically closed after their block is executed, reducing the risk of resource leaks.
- **Reading vs. Writing vs. Appending:**
  - `"r"`: Read mode (default).
  - `"w"`: Write mode (overwrites file or creates it).
  - `"a"`: Append mode (adds to the end, creates file if missing).
- **Text Encoding:**
  - Use `encoding="utf-8"` to support all text characters.
- **File Object Methods:**
  - `.read()`: Reads the entire file.
  - `.write(text)`: Writes a string to a file and returns number of characters written.
- **JSON Operations:**
  - `json.dump()`, `json.load()`, `json.dumps()`, `json.loads()` to serialize and deserialize data.
- **Safe Printing:**
  - Print only valid data types, handle errors gracefully.
- **Command Line Scripting:**
  - Use `sys.argv` to access command-line arguments for flexible file-processing scripts.

## üë©‚Äçüíª What I Practiced

- Reading and writing files using different modes.
- Using context managers for safe and efficient file handling.
- Converting Python objects to JSON format and back.
- Appending data to existing files without overwriting.
- Building scripts that process input from the user or command line.
- Writing simple, readable, and robust file-handling functions.
