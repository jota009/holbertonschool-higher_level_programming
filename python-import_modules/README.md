# Python - Import & Modules 📦🐍

This project dives into Python's module system. It teaches how to import functions and variables, work with command-line arguments, and organize reusable code effectively. It also introduces special built-in behaviors like `__name__` and the `dir()` function.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I was able to explain:

- ✅ How to import functions from another file
- ✅ How to use imported functions and variables
- ✅ How to create and structure a Python module
- ✅ The purpose of the built-in `dir()` function
- ✅ How to prevent code from executing when a script is imported
- ✅ How to use command-line arguments with `sys.argv`

## 📂 Tasks Completed

- `0-add.py`: Imports a function from another file and prints the result of an addition
- `1-calculation.py`: Imports multiple math functions and calls them
- `2-args.py`: Prints the number and list of command-line arguments
- `3-infinite_add.py`: Adds all command-line arguments passed to the script
- `4-hidden_discovery.py`: Prints all names defined by a hidden module, excluding `__` names
- `5-variable_load.py`: Imports and prints the value of a variable from another script

## 🧠 Skills Gained

- Importing specific functions or variables
- Using `if __name__ == "__main__"` to control script execution
- Understanding Python’s module behavior and namespace
- Using `sys.argv` to access command-line arguments
- Listing available names in a module using `dir()`
